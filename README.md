# Arxiv-Paper-Scraper
Crawling the web and scraping paper's from arxiv.org using Scrapy and Google's programmable search engine.

Originally made to crawl the websites of university ML reading groups (hence the name of the Scrapy project folder), 
but the program can be used to seek out arxiv.org papers given any list of Google search inputs.
